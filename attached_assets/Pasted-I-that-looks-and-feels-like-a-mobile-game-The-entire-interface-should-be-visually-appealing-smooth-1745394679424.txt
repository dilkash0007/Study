I that looks and feels like a mobile game. The entire interface should be visually appealing, smooth, colorful, and immersive — just like a high-quality mobile RPG or strategy game.

The theme should combine education with adventure, motivation, and fun. Every screen should have visual depth, glowing buttons, animated progress, sound feedback, and reward elements like coins, levels, and badges.

Use a fantasy-inspired or futuristic color palette (like deep purples, neon blues, warm golds). Include soft shadows, glowing borders, gradient-filled buttons, and lively icons. Typography should be bold and readable, like a game HUD.

UI Components to include:

🏠 Home Screen — A game-style dashboard with floating islands or cards representing "Subjects", each showing XP, progress bar, and level badge.

🧠 Study Arena — A Pomodoro-style timer screen designed like a battle arena. The user “fights distraction” while studying. Progress bar = health bar. Timer = countdown to victory.

🎯 Quests Section — Gamified task list as "Daily Missions" and "Epic Quests". Completing tasks grants coins, gems, or XP. Animated success feedback.

🏆 Leaderboard — Styled like a ranking tower with glowing avatars, crowns, and level icons. Includes animation when a player levels up or surpasses others.

🎖️ Achievement Vault — A treasure room UI showcasing unlocked achievements with 3D badges, sound effects, and particle animations.

⚙️ Settings & Character — Customize profile like a game character with skins, avatars, titles (e.g. “Focus Master”, “Task Warrior”).

🌌 Backgrounds & Animations — Parallax backgrounds, smooth UI transitions, button hover effects, animated icons (e.g., glowing brain, pulsing stars).

🎮 Navigation Bar — Game-style menu bar with icons like a joystick menu: Home, Battle, Quests, Vault, Settings.

All elements must have real, working functions. Each button must perform a task, navigate to a real feature, or trigger an action. UX must be intuitive but playful, like an interactive game world.
